### **Algorithm Engineer Intern**  
**March 2025 – July 2025 | Hikvision Research Institute （Hangzhou）**  

- Built and optimized the multimodal foundation model v1.5. Automated evaluation of 30M interleaved docs from OBELICS, MMC4, and in-house corpora. 

- Designed a Qwen2.5VL-7B–based metric that quantifies image-text complementarity via next-token likelihood gain, cutting computation by 85 % and boosting screening accuracy by 30 %. 

- Engineered a FAISS-based retrieval pipeline to synthesize 32-domain QA pairs enriched with structured figures, then orchestrated multi-node vLLM inference to scale generation. Conducted Megatron-LM distributed SFT on 7 B / 32 B models, raising MMMU benchmark scores.
