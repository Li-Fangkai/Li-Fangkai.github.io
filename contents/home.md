I’m an M.S. student in Software Engineering at Shandong University, having completed my B.S. in Data Science & Big Data Technology here as well. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/luxiankai/zh_CN/index.htm">Prof. Xiankai Lu</a> at Shandong University. 

My research interests lie in multimodal feature alignment, video grounding and large-scale vision–language models.
