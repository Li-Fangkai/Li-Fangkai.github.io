I’m an M.S. student in Software Engineering at Shandong University, having completed my B.S. in Data Science & Big Data Technology here as well. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiankai Lu at Shandong University. My research interests lie in multimodal feature matching and the alignment of large-scale vision–language models.
